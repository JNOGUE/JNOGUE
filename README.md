### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John-David Noguera! Thanks for taking some time to look around! 


 ðŸ”­ I am John-David Noguera a junior web developer with a vested interests in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing
 
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python with hopes to eventually utilize it in a professional capacity and create machine learning based applications!
 
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to ChatGPT, machine learning, and Algos/DS! 
 
 âš¡ Fun fact: I like to stay pretty active mentally and physically outside of programming so you can find me doing calisthenics in the wee hours of the morning, going for walks on my lunch break, and engaging in upkeeping my mandarin langauge skills. I have also been told I am a phenomenol cook.
